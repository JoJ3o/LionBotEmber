"""
The initial Shopping Cog acts as the entry point to the shopping system.
It provides the commands:
    /shop open [type:<acmpl str>]
    /shop buy <item:<acmpl str>>
It also provides the "/editshop" group,
which each shop type should hook into (via placeholder groups)
to provide a shop creation and edit interface.

A "Shop" represents a colour shop, role shop, boost shop, etc.
Each Shop has a different editing interface (the ShopCog),
and a different user interface page (the Store).

When a user runs /shop open, the "StoreManager" opens.
This PagedUI serves as a top-level manager for each shop store,
even though it has no UI elements itself.

The user sees the first Store page, and can freely use the store UI
to interact with that Shop.
They may also use the "shop row" buttons to switch between shops.

Now, onto the individual shop systems.

When the user first opens a shop, a Customer is created.
The Customer represents the member themselves (i.e. the lion),
along with their inventory (a list of raw items that they own).
For fast access (for e.g. autocomplete), the Customer may be
cached, as long as it has a unique registry map.

Each initialised Shop has a collection of ShopItems.
The ShopItems represent individual objects of that shop,
and usually contain state particular to that shop.
The ShopItems shouldn't need to remember their origin shop,
or the Customer.

The Shop itself handles purchases, checking whether a customer can purchase
a given item, and running the purchase logic for an item.

Note: Timing out Acmpl state to handle caching shared states between acmpl?

Note: shop_item_info table which joins the others? Include guild_item_id,
and cache the items.

/shop open:
    - Create the Customer
    - Initialise the Shops, with the current Guild and the Customer
    - Pass the shop stores to the StoreManager, along with the command interaction
    - Run display on the StoreManager, which displays the first Store UI
        - The StoreManager gets a store button from each store, then passes those back to the individuals
        - This would be best done with a UILayout modification, but we don't have that yet
    - The Store displays its UI, which is Customer-dependent, relying on the Shop for most computations.
    - (The Store might not even need to keep the Customer, just using Shop methods to access them.)
    - The Customer may make a purchase/refund/etc, which gets mapped back to the Shop.
    - After the Customer has made an action, the Store refreshes its UI, from the Shop data.
/shop buy <item>:
    - Instantiates the Customer and Shops (via acmpl state?), which should _not_ require any data lookups.
    - Acmpl shows an intelligent list of matching items, nicely formatted
    - (Shopitem itself can be responsible for formatting?)
    - (Shop can be responsible for showing which items the user can purchase?)
    - Command gets the shopitemid (possibly partitioned by guild), gets that item, gets the item Shop.
    - Command then gets the Shop to purchase that item.
